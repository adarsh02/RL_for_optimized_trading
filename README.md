# Objective

The paper addresses the "one-way trading" problem, focusing on optimizing trade execution to maximize revenue. Specifically, the objective is to sell V shares within a time horizon H while maximizing the revenue generated from the trades.

# Dataset Used

The implementation utilizes a dataset comprising one day's time series limit order book (LOB) data for the AMZN stock. The data is represented in seconds and is sourced from the LOBSTER database.
